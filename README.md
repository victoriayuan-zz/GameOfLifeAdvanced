# GameOfLifeAdvanced

A zombie-based simulation of Conway's Game of Life

This Java Swing project was created in 2014 and puts a fun twist on the basic Game of Life using unique life forms. Running the Main.java file will begin the simulation. In addition to all the new characters that were added to the game, the JSlider allows users to choose the success rate in which they want to eradicate or populate a certain area. The JComboList also allows users to choose what kind of character they would like to eradicate or populate. The game also adds "Natural Disasters" at the bottom of the screen which arbitrarily kill characters. 

A comprehensive list of characters:
Foods: Humans must consume foods for a certain amount of time before they die. Food is arbitrarily generated by the game.
Humans: Humans can be killed by lack of food or if they come in contact with zombies. A male and a female can also reproduce if they are above/below each other. Humans in red boxes will warn the player that they are starving and require food.
Zombies: Able to kill humans if they are in consecutive grids. Consequently, the human victim will turn into a zombie.
Zombie Hunters: Able to kill zombies if they are in consecutive grids.
